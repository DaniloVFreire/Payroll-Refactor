## Introduction

This is the second part of **payroll system**, this project objective is to **apply the
concepts of project patterns and code smells** learned in
the programming 2 discipline.

## Project functionalities

The project structure is focused on **simulating
a corporate payroll system** that includes:

## Refactoring process
### Code Smells
1. **Code duplication** Code repetition in **constructors of employee's**;
2. **Large Class** all "toString" methods and "dataManager" constructor are doing more than it should
3. **Expeculative generality** creation of unused classes and methods
### Solutions
1. Fixed with **Chain constructors** in [commit]();
2. Fixed with **Stract method** in [commit]();
3. Fixed with **Remove Generative Speculation** in [commit]();
