## Introduction

This is the second part of **payroll system**, this project objective is to **apply the
concepts of project patterns and code smells** learned in
the programming 2 discipline.

## Project functionalities

The project structure is focused on **simulating
a corporate payroll system** that includes:

## Refactoring process
### Code Smells
1. **Code duplication** Code repetition in **constructors of employee's**;
2. **Large Class** all "toString" methods and "dataManager" constructor are doing more than it should
3. **Envy method** in all "toString" methods in the subclasses of employee
4. **Speculative generality** creation of unused classes and methods
5. **Large "textInterface" class** with switch chain
### Solutions
1. Fixed with **Chain constructors** in [commit](https://github.com/DaniloVFreire/Payroll-Refactor/commit/c1109fb38b292a21cee3a6b971d8f1c5a0ca4c2e);
2. Fixed with **Extract method** in [commit](https://github.com/DaniloVFreire/Payroll-Refactor/commit/d8a01a4da61b0a87ccd326d8b0af9921ccacda38); 
3. Fixed with **Extract method** in [commit](https://github.com/DaniloVFreire/Payroll-Refactor/commit/d8a01a4da61b0a87ccd326d8b0af9921ccacda38);
4. Fixed with **Remove Generative Speculation** in [commit](https://github.com/DaniloVFreire/Payroll-Refactor/commit/e153517df7599a26f84b6e12fe986a972c271f9d);
5. Fixed with the implementation of **command** in [commit](https://github.com/DaniloVFreire/Payroll-Refactor/commit/280e9d05adfa744c37344b85a3eeed2a2ed62436);
